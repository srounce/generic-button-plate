# Generic Button Plate

A simple open-source button plate for wheels with 70mm PCD mounting bolts. Over
time I hope to evolve the design and software with the goal of creating an
affordable, generously featured sim wheel that can be constructed with minimal
experience and no tools other than a 3d printer and a soldering iron.

The project is still a work in progress, though the initial physical design is
done, I'm still working on the first version of the firmware.

FreeCAD design source files can be found in the `design` directory.

Exported 3d printable STL files are available in the `print` directory.

## Roadmap

### In progress

- USB HID firmware
- Complete BOM
- Build instructions

### Future goals

- Custom PCB
- Bespoke shifter paddles
- SimHub integration
- [Monocoque](https://github.com/Spacefreak18/monocoque) integration
- 'Funky switch' option
- More Encoders

## Features

- 10 Buttons
- Shifter paddle mounting points
- Multi-function rotary encoder
- Encoder mode selection via rotary switch
- Can be built for for under Â£50 GBP (including the wheel)
- RGB LEDs!
